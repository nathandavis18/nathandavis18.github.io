                    <p>
                        I was originally interested in programming because I wanted to learn how games were made and wanted to make my own. 
                        I chose to enroll at Weber State University due to all the positive things I had heard about it, and I can say that I made a good choice.
                        During my time in Weber's computer science degree, I started to enjoy the software engineering side of programming more and more. <br /> <br />
                        
                        Outside of my time at Weber and work, I enjoy spending my time working on individual projects, spending time with my family, and playing some of my favorite games.
                        I also frequently do independent research to further hone my programming skills. I am a motivated self-learner, and pride myself in being the best that I can.
