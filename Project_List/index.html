                        A standalone website, built using C# and the .NET Core 7.0 Framework, that allows students to schedule available appointments with their instructors, advisors, and tutors.
                        This project was designed to be a <a href="https://simplybook.me/en/" target="_blank" title="alternative">SimplyBook.me</a> alternative, specifically tailored for 
                        Weber State University students and faculty.

                        With this appointment scheduler, students are able to register for an account manually, or alternatively through Google and Microsoft external authentication. 
                        If they want, users are able to integrate their Steamboat Willie account with their Google Calendar, automatically adding and removing appointments to and from their Google Calendar.

                    <p class="project-body">
                        This is a co-op/multiplayer version of Tetris built using C++ and SFML. This allows up to 4 players at once. Players must work together to survive, as the board fills up fast.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-body">
                        The board scales depending on the number of players. One player is normal board, two players is slightly bigger, etc. At 4 players, the board is double the size of a standard tetris board. 
                        If you would like to try it out, feel free to clone the repository linked above. CMake 3.16 is required to build. Currently, the main menu is a blank 
                        black screen. Just click 1, 2, 3, or 4 on your keyboard to choose the number of players and the game will start!

                        Currently there is no way to change controls, but that is a feature I am currently working on along with the Main Menu GUI. 
                        If you would like to restart the game with the same number of players, just press F5!

                        These are some custom implementations of some Data Structures and Algorithms using C++. Currently, I have built a custom, templated vector class, iterator and reverse iterator classes, 
                        an introsort (introspective sort) algorithm, and a merging algorithm, which merges two sorted vectors/arrays/containers into one single vector/array/container.

                        This custom vector class performs similarly to the STL version of std::vector. This is a fully templated implementation, allowing for both standard and custom types. 
                        Because this is a vector, and not an array, the contents of the vector are stored on the heap, with data being allocated using std::allocator_traits.

                        std::vector::insert(std::vector::begin(), value) and std::vector::erase(std::vector::begin()) respectively.

                        These are custom forward and reverse random-access compliant iterators. They are fully templated, allowing the use of these iterators for both standard and custom types.

                    <p class="project-body-2">
                        Iterators, in a nutshell, are incremental pointers. You can use the dereference operator * to access the value pointed to by the iterator and 
                        the -> operator to set a value/call a function from the iterator. Additionally, you can do ++it / --it to increment/decrement the iterator, rather than doing ptr + i or ptr - i.

                    <p class="project-body-2">
                        Iterators are useful when iterating over objects in a container, such as a list, when calculating the size of the container may be an expensive operation.

                    <p class="project-body-2">
                        This is my custom implementation of the introsort algorithm. This algorithm is designed to allow sorting of any type, given that type has a comparison operator. This includes custom types with custom defined comparison operators.
                        Introsort, otherwise known as introspective sort, is a hybrid comparitive sorting algorithm that provides optimal worst-case performance, 
                        with a Time Complexity of O(n log n), and a Space Complexity of O(log n). The 3 parts to introsort are Quicksort, Heapsort, and Insertion Sort.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-body-2">
                        Quicksort is implemented as the base of the introsort algorithm, sorting partitions around a pivot. I decided to use a median-of-3 selection algorithm to determine the pivot. 
                        The median-of-3 selection algorithm takes the first, middle, and last elements of a given partition and moves it to the first position in the container. 
                        This approach has better performance on average than just using the first or last element as the pivot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-body-2">
                        After a specific max recursion depth is hit, which is determined by calculating the log2(container_size) * 2, heapsort is ran instead of quicksort. 
                        Heapsort essentially constructs a binary tree in-place, requiring O(1) space. Unlike normal balanced binary trees, where right > parent > left, in the heapsort implementation parent > right and parent > left.
                        This places the largest element at the root of the tree. Once the tree is constructed, you can traverse up the tree, removing nodes as they are put into their sorted place.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-body-2">
                        When heapsort is finished, insertion sort makes all of the final touches as needed. Although insertion sort has a worst-case performance of O(n^2) time complexity, 
                        its performance on smaller partitions, as well as arrays that are mostly sorted, is better than most sorting algorithms.

                    <p class="project-body-2">
                        This custom implementation of a merging algorithm allows you to merge two sorted containers into a single container. This algorithm does not ensure that both containers are sorted, 
                        so attempting to use this algorithm with one or more unsorted arrays will result in undefined behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-body-2">
                        This algorithm implements the two-pointer method. A pointer is set to the first object of each container. If the value of the 2nd container is less than the value of the 1st container, the 2nd value comes first. 
                        Otherwise, the 1st value comes first. Then, whichever pointer had the smaller value moves forward. This continues until one container has finished moving all its elements, after which the remaining elements of the other 
                        container are copied over directly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-body-2">
                        This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two containers. It has a space complexity of O(n + m) as well, since unless n or m == 0, additional space is required.
